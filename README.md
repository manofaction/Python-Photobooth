# Python-powered Photobooth

These scripts power a photobooth by controlling a DSLR from a Raspberry Pi.  The photobooth displays the image just taken, so guests get the immediate satisfaction of seeing their picture, and saves the full-size images to be shared later on social media or printed out.

1. Guests strike a pose and step on an invitingly large red button on the floor
2. LEDs flash to draw attention to the camera lens
3. Camera takes the picture
4. Picture is displayed on-screen for immediate viewing\

5. RAW image stays on camera for later retrieval\
